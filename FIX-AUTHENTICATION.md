# ðŸ”“ Fix Backend Authentication Issue

## Problem
Your backend has Vercel's Deployment Protection enabled, which is blocking API requests.

## âœ… Solution: Disable Deployment Protection

### **Step 1: Go to Backend Project Settings**

1. Visit: https://vercel.com/itsamazons-projects/studio-x-leaderboard-backend
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Deployment Protection** in the left sidebar

### **Step 2: Disable Protection**

You'll see options like:
- **Vercel Authentication**
- **Password Protection**  
- **Trusted IPs**

**For your API backend, you need:**
- âœ… Turn OFF **Vercel Authentication**
- âœ… Turn OFF **Password Protection**
- âœ… Turn OFF any other protection

**Why?** Your backend is an API that needs to accept requests from your frontend apps (which are on different domains). The CORS settings you added handle security.

### **Step 3: Save Changes**

Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

## Alternative: Use Environment Variables for Auth

If Vercel won't let you disable protection, add these to your backend **Environment Variables**:

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
2. Add:
   ```
   VERCEL_PROTECT_BYPASS=1
   ```
3. Click **Save**

---

## âœ… Test After Disabling

```bash
curl https://studio-x-leaderboard-backend-kg1by1e96-itsamazons-projects.vercel.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"healthy","environment":"production"}
```

If it returns HTML with "Authentication Required", the protection is still enabled.

## ðŸŽ¯ After Fixing

Once protection is disabled:

1. Your frontend apps will be able to call the backend
2. Test the admin panel: https://studio-x-leaderboard-admin.vercel.app
3. Everything should work! âœ…

**This is a common issue with Vercel - APIs shouldn't have deployment protection!**

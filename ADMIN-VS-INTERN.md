# 🔧 Admin vs 👀 Intern View - Comparison

## Current Status

Both `App-admin.tsx` and `App-intern.tsx` exist, but let's verify the differences:

---

## ✅ App-intern.tsx (View-Only)

### What it SHOULD have:
- ✅ View leaderboard (weekly and cumulative)
- ✅ Switch between weekly/cumulative views
- ✅ Select week dropdown
- ✅ Export CSV/PDF
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- ✅ "👀 Intern View" badge in header
- ✅ View breakdown of scores (read-only)

### What it should NOT have:
- ❌ No "Add Intern" button
- ❌ No "Add Week" button  
- ❌ No "Manage Interns" button
- ❌ No "Manage Weeks" button
- ❌ No "Edit" buttons in leaderboard
- ❌ No "Delete" buttons in leaderboard
- ❌ No grading functionality
- ❌ No strategist selection

---

## 🔧 App-admin.tsx (Full Access)

### What it HAS:
- ✅ Everything from intern view PLUS:
- ✅ "➕ Add Intern" button
- ✅ "📅 Add Week" button
- ✅ "👥 Manage Interns" button
- ✅ "📅 Manage Weeks" button
- ✅ "Edit" buttons in leaderboard rows
- ✅ "Delete" buttons in leaderboard rows
- ✅ Grade metrics modal
- ✅ Select strategists for new weeks
- ✅ "🔧 Admin Panel" badge in header

---

## 🔍 Current Implementation

Let me verify the current state of both files...

### App-intern.tsx:
- Uses `viewOnly={true}` for leaderboard components ✅
- No modals imported (AddInternModal, ManageInternsModal, etc.) ✅
- No admin buttons in the UI ✅
- Has "👀 Intern View" badge ✅

### App-admin.tsx:
- Has all admin functionality ✅
- Has "🔧 Admin Panel" badge ✅
- Full CRUD operations ✅

## 📝 What's Deployed

Check these URLs to verify:

1. **Admin Panel**: Should have all buttons
   - URL: https://studio-x-leaderboard-admin-48xvi3azp-itsamazons-projects.vercel.app

2. **Intern View**: Should be view-only, no admin buttons
   - URL: https://leaderboard-calculator-30kq4pgqq-itsamazons-projects.vercel.app

---

## 🧪 Local Testing

Currently running `npm run dev` which uses `src/main.tsx`:

```typescript
// Check what's imported in src/main.tsx:
import App from './App-admin.tsx'  // or './App-intern.tsx'
```

To test locally:
1. Change `main.tsx` to import `./App-admin.tsx` - see admin view
2. Change `main.tsx` to import `./App-intern.tsx` - see intern view

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

When you open the **Intern View**, you should see:
- Leaderboard with scores
- Week selector dropdown
- View toggle (Weekly/Cumulative)
- Export buttons (CSV/PDF)
- **NO** add, edit, delete, or manage buttons
- Auto-refresh badge/indicator

The table should have **NO "Actions" column** at all.

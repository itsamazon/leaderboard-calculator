## 🎓 Our Philosophy

This isn't about creating pressure - it's about **creating clarity**. Every intern deserves to know:
- How they're performing
- What they're doing well
- Where they can improve
- How to level up

The leaderboard celebrates excellence while providing actionable feedback for growth. It's a tool for development, not just evaluation.
